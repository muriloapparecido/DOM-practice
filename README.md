# DOM Manipulation Practice

This repository contains my practice work for learning and experimenting with **DOM Manipulation** in JavaScript. The purpose of this project is to strengthen my understanding of working with the DOM and dynamically creating/updating HTML elements using JavaScript.


### Tools and Skills Used
- **HTML**: Provides the base structure of the web page.
- **CSS (Basic)**: Some styling is applied inline using JavaScript.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation**:
    - `document.createElement()`
    - `document.querySelector()`
    - `element.appendChild()`
    - Setting styles dynamically.
